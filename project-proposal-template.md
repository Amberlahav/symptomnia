# Project Proposal

## Project Name
> Symptomnia

## Description
> A web application that lets you track occurrences of symptoms, either for personal records or for presenting to doctors to get a professional diagnosis.

## MVC Goals
> Create a new symptom. The symptom will include a name, and (optional) notes about the symptom
> Create a new entry within the symptom. The entry will have to include a date, time, severity and (optional) note.
> View & search all symptoms (list format with details such as name, number of total entries and average severity)
> Click on a symptom and view all past entries (list format with details such as time/date, severity and notes if applicable)
> Delete a symptom
## Stretch Goals
> Within a symptom - be able to toggle list view & calendar view that will show the entries in different forms
> Be able to get a stats page for a symptom that will show a chart of the severity & frequency over time 
> Be able to export a symptom's entries as PDF and save to computer
